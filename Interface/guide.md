# **Interface Guide**
We have divided the entire application into 3 separate CLIs - CLI_User, CLI_Admin and
CLI_Employee.
As suggested by their names, each CLI is supposed to be used by a speciﬁc entity.
While User and Admin are separate entities, Employee is to be used by both employees
involved in assistance and delivery.

Apart from all these features, the application contains exception handling on multiple
levels to provide a more robust end application.
The options are designed in a way to ensure a smooth user experience even with the
handicap of a command line interface, connecting all options in a way that allows absolute
connectivity between them. Sub-options provided within each option are provided considering
the scope of that option and the overall application so that no critical functionality is lost.
