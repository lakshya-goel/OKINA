The individual data set generated for each table is submitted within the
folder named **table_data**

## Database Schema:
A total of 23 tables (or relations) are created using standard SQL
commands. These include tables for strong entities, weak entities,
relationships and multi-valued attributes. An SQL file - tables.sql contains
all the queries used in the process.


## DDL
The tables, triggers and other definitions for the database are written in DDL.sql\
Running tables.sql will generate the entire database filled with appropriate values that can be worked on

## Integrity constraints:
All the necessary constraints in DDL are added to the aforementioned
tables. These constraints include but are not limited to primary key, foreign
key, not null, unique and check.
